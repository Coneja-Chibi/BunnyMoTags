## 🥕 What is BunnyMoTags?

BunnyMoTags is your **tag consistency guardian** for BunnyMo packs! It tracks character traits across your lorebooks, prevents AI hallucination of incorrect tags, and automatically injects consistent character data when names are mentioned - just like Guided Generations, but specifically designed for the BunnyMo ecosystem.

No more wondering "wait, was Luna a kitsune or a neko?" or having your AI suddenly decide your carefully crafted tsundere is actually a yandere. BunnyMoTags **remembers everything** and keeps your character consistency rock-solid.

> *"It's like having a personal character continuity editor that actually knows your BunnyMo packs inside and out!"* 🎯

## 🚀 The BunnyMoTags Workflow


### Step 1: Load Your BunnyMo Arsenal 🥕
Install your favorite BunnyMo packs. Pick and choose your favorites. <img width="689" height="264" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca933b20-13c0-4933-b7fc-9d66c69a6da2" />



### Step 2: Pick your tag packs, (The Dere, MBTI, Linguistics, etc packs) And make sure they are ***labeled as such.***<img width="165" height="143" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d8949df-b568-4643-a538-65f3e8d33486" />


### Step 3: Make a lorebook that you will use as a 'Character respository' (Examples can be found in the main Bunnymo file as to how they should be set up.) <img width="1157" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9983e123-3088-48a6-96ee-24cac4cf9a3f" /> Then run the !fullsheet command either in chat for using the new BunnyRecc system; and copy all the tags output at the bottom into the Lorebook entry pictured above. Example: <img width="1159" height="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6228546a-b7cd-4658-9441-80958c9a09a7" />

Step 4: In the same place you chose your tag libraries, go back and select your character repo, and click the tag library symbol to toggle it to its other function. (Unsure if you did it right? Click the scan selected lorebooks button!) <img width="677" height="244" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e74ad6-9a77-4f28-bf52-075ce268bcd4" />


Step 5: RP! And watch your characters tags be used the *right* way (hopefully lmao) each and every time! Unsure if their traits are actually being injected? Check your settings and toggle 'character cards' on! Or check the COT and see if the tags are being explicitly mentioned.
