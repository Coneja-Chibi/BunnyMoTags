## 🥕 What is BunnyMoTags?

BunnyMoTags is your **tag consistency guardian** for BunnyMo packs! It tracks character traits across your lorebooks, prevents AI hallucination of incorrect tags, and automatically injects consistent character data when names are mentioned - just like Guided Generations, but specifically designed for the BunnyMo ecosystem.

No more wondering "wait, was Luna a kitsune or a neko?" or having your AI suddenly decide your carefully crafted tsundere is actually a yandere. BunnyMoTags **remembers everything** and keeps your character consistency rock-solid.

> *"It's like having a personal character continuity editor that actually knows your BunnyMo packs inside and out!"* 🎯
